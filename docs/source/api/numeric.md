environment
    A structure where information about all documents under the root is
    saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
    after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
    and parse new and changed documents.

haha
source directory
    The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
    source files for one Sphinx project.
